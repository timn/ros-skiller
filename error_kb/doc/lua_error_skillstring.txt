= lua_error_skillstring: syntax error in input skill string =

== Cause ==
The error is caused by a malformed skill string which is passed for execution to the skiller. When the skiller tried to compile the string into a function the Lua interpreter raised an error.

The skill string could have been sent, for example, via the SkillGUI or the luaagent.

== Solution ==
To solve the problem analyze the human readable error message, it contains the the input skill string and the information from the Lua interpreter.

== Recovery Strategy ==
No recovery is necessary, the skiller is usable again immediately, the input string will just be discarded. Note however, that an agent program must take the failed skill into account.

From the perspective of the agent, such an error may be fatal because it is a programming error that cannot be solved automatically and for which alternative execution paths of the behavior might not exist.
