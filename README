skiller: Skill Execution and Run-Time environment for ROS
=========================================================

This package forms the heart of the behavior engine. It includes a node that,
when run, creates the Lua environment for skill development, execution, and
monitoring. It implements a reactive behavior layer, in which arbitrary
execution schemes can be implemented. It provides specific tool support to
employ the approach of extended hybrid state machines.

Requirements
------------
It builds on utility packages from the behavior_engine stack. Additionally,
it uses actionlib via actionlib_lua to make use of functionality provided
by the base system and other ROS nodes.

Documentation
-------------
Guides and howtos are currently work in progress. For now we would like to
refer to the example set of skills provided in the herb_skills package.
